# Git (and Github) Training

Whenever I introduce someone to the wonders of version control with git and github, I like to go through examples and show them how to go about doing things. This often leads to me to creating (and then deleting) a repo. To avoid this process I am creating this repo for the explicit purpose of teaching people how to use git and github.
